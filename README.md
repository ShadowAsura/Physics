# 2D Physics Engine

A simple and interactive 2D physics simulation built using Pygame. This engine allows users to visualize and interact with various physics concepts, including pendulums, springs, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/ShadowAsura/Physics.git
```

2. Run the main script:

```
python3 main.py
```

## Usage

1. Use the UI to switch between different scenes.
2. Interact with the objects in each scene using the mouse or keyboard commands.

## Roadmap

### Planned Features

- **Suspension Systens**: Simulate the motion of spring suspensions.
- **Rotational Motion**: Interact with systems under rotational or simple harmonic motion.
- **Soft Bodies**: Create and interact with systems of interconnected particles.

### Updated Features

- **Spring Chain Interaction**: Users can now interact with each spring in the chain.
  **Pendulum Interaction**: Users can now interact with a Pendulum on an elastic rope.
- **Fluid System**: Interactable fluid system.
